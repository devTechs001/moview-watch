# ðŸš€ Netlify Deployment Guide - Fixed

## Issue Fixed

### Error: Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist

**Problem:**
- Netlify was looking for `dist` in root directory
- Vite builds to `client/dist`
- Configuration mismatch caused deployment failure

**Solution:**
- Created `netlify.toml` in root directory
- Set `base = "client"` to specify build directory
- Set `publish = "client/dist"` for correct output path

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prerequisites

âœ… GitHub repository created and code pushed
âœ… Netlify account created (https://netlify.com)
âœ… Backend deployed separately (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.)

### 2. Connect Repository to Netlify

**Option A: Netlify Dashboard**

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click **"Add new site"** â†’ **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **GitHub** (authorize if needed)
4. Select your repository: `movie-app`
5. Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`
6. Click **"Deploy site"**

**Option B: Netlify CLI**

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Initialize
netlify init

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In Netlify Dashboard:

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Add the following variables:

```
VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend.railway.app/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL = https://your-backend.railway.app
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY = your_tmdb_api_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_your_stripe_key
```

**Important:** Replace with your actual backend URL and API keys

### 4. Trigger Deployment

**Automatic:**
- Push to main branch â†’ Auto-deploys

**Manual:**
- Netlify Dashboard â†’ **Deploys** â†’ **Trigger deploy**

## Configuration Files

### netlify.toml (Root Directory)

```toml
[build]
  base = "client"              # Build from client folder
  command = "npm run build"    # Build command
  publish = "client/dist"      # Output directory
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"          # Node version

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"                  # All routes
  to = "/index.html"           # Redirect to index
  status = 200                 # SPA routing
```

### Key Settings Explained

**`base = "client"`**
- Tells Netlify to run commands from `client` folder
- Fixes the "dist does not exist" error

**`publish = "client/dist"`**
- Path to built files (relative to repo root)
- Where Netlify serves files from

**`command = "npm run build"`**
- Runs Vite build
- Creates production bundle

**Redirects**
- Enables client-side routing
- All routes serve `index.html`
- React Router handles navigation

---

## Build Process

### What Happens During Build

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Build Command**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Vite Build Output**
   ```
   client/dist/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].js
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].css
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [other assets]
   â””â”€â”€ [other files]
   ```

4. **Deploy to Netlify CDN**
   - Files uploaded to global CDN
   - Site becomes live

### How to Set in Netlify

1. **Dashboard Method:**
   - Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Click "Add a variable"
   - Enter key and value
   - Click "Create variable"

2. **CLI Method:**
   ```bash
   netlify env:set VITE_API_URL "https://your-backend.railway.app/api"
   netlify env:set VITE_SOCKET_URL "https://your-backend.railway.app"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "dist does not exist"

**Solution:**
âœ… Ensure `netlify.toml` is in root directory
âœ… Check `base = "client"` is set
âœ… Verify `publish = "client/dist"`

### Issue 2: Build Fails - "npm: command not found"

**Solution:**
âœ… Set `NODE_VERSION = "18"` in netlify.toml
âœ… Or set in Netlify dashboard: Build settings â†’ Environment

### Issue 3: 404 on Page Refresh

**Solution:**
âœ… Add redirects in netlify.toml:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Issue 4: API Calls Fail

**Solution:**
âœ… Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
âœ… Ensure backend is deployed and running
âœ… Check CORS settings on backend
âœ… Verify backend URL is correct

### Issue 5: Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution:**
âœ… Variables must start with `VITE_`
âœ… Redeploy after adding variables
âœ… Check variable names match code

### Issue 6: Build Takes Too Long

**Solution:**
âœ… Check build logs for errors
âœ… Optimize dependencies
âœ… Use build plugins if needed
