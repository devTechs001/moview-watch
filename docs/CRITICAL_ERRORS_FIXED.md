## 3. ⚠️ NOT A CODE ERROR: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
**Error:** `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
**Cause:** **YOUR SERVER IS NOT RUNNING!**
**This is NOT a code error - you need to start the server!**

---

## 🚨 THE REAL PROBLEM: SERVER NOT RUNNING

All these errors are because **your backend server is not running**:
- ❌ ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- ❌ Failed to load resource
- ❌ POST /api/posts 500
- ❌ Error fetching movies
- ❌ Error fetching wishlist

**These are NOT code errors - they're connection errors!**

---

## ⚡ SOLUTION: START YOUR SERVER (30 SECONDS)

### Step 1: Start MongoDB
```bash
net start MongoDB
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Wait for this message:**
```
✅ Server running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected
```

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
Press `Ctrl + F5` to hard refresh

---

## ✅ AFTER SERVER STARTS

All errors will disappear:
- ✅ No more ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- ✅ Movies will load
- ✅ Wishlist will load
- ✅ Posts will work

## 📋 VERIFY SERVER IS RUNNING

## 💡 COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: "I started the client but not the server"
**Solution:** You need BOTH running:
- Terminal 1: `cd server && npm run dev`
- Terminal 2: `cd client && npm run dev`

### Mistake 2: "MongoDB is not running"
**Solution:** Start MongoDB first:
```bash
net start MongoDB
```

### Mistake 3: "I closed the terminal"
**Solution:** Keep terminals open while using the app

---

## 🚀 COMPLETE STARTUP SEQUENCE

```bash
# Step 1: Start MongoDB
net start MongoDB

# Step 2: Open NEW terminal - Start Server
cd c:\Users\Melanie\react-projects\movie-app\server
npm run dev
# Wait for: "Server running on port 5000"

# Step 3: Open NEW terminal - Start Client
cd c:\Users\Melanie\react-projects\movie-app\client
npm run dev
# Wait for: "Local: http://localhost:5173"

# Step 4: Open Browser
# Go to: http://localhost:5173
```

## 🆘 IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Problem: MongoDB won't start
```bash
# Download and install MongoDB from:
# https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud):
# Update server/.env with Atlas connection string
```

### Problem: Port 5000 already in use
```bash
# Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# Then restart server
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Problem: Missing dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
